During the school year, the space is open every weekday, serving as a place for students to relax and unwind between classes or as the venue for various events hosted by Vic clubs and groups. With a Games Room complete with pool tables, air hockey, table tennis, foosball, and an arcade dance machine, as well as a Gaming Corner with all sorts of systems, thereâ€™s something for everyone looking to kick back and enjoy their free time or chat with friends.</h3>
